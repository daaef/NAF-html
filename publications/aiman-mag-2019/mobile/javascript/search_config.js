The publication is timely since it                                                serves as an authentic medium for information dissemination                                                and public enlightenment on the NAF's activities, particularly as                                                it marked its 55th Anniversary.                                                 Indeed, the focus of this special edition on the 55th Anniversary                                                has underscored the compelling need to have a platform through                                                which the NAF would tell its stories. I have no doubt that this                                                edition  will  serve  as  a  worthy  platform  for  information                                                dissemination  to  members  of  the  general  public  as  we                                                collectively  confront  and  combat  the  numerous  security                                                challenges and criminalities we face today. The resolve to be                                                professional can only be eﬀectively enhanced through constant                                                training and retraining. I therefore urge the NAF to sustain its                                                well-known high standards of discipline and vigorous training                                                while  conforming  to  international  best  practices  in  all  tasks                                                when and wherever assigned.                                                On  behalf  of  oﬃcers  and  soldiers  of  the  Nigerian  Army,  I                                                applaud the indefatigable Chief of the Air Staﬀ, oﬃcers and men                                                of the NAF for this noble initiative which will go a long way                                                towards projecting the image of the Service. This magazine will                                                in  no  small  way  positively  showcase  some  landmark                                                innovations, activities and achievements recorded by the NAF. It                                                will be a medium through which the air force will communicate                                                its renewed commitment as we collectively march forward to                                                confront the challenges confronting our nation.                                                 Finally, I commend the editorial board for packaging this special                                                edition of the Airman Magazine. I also look forward to more                                                publications of the magazine in the future.

According to the former spokesperson for the Nigerian Air Force, Group                                                     Captain Shehu (rtd) noted that Baba-Ari has shown exceptional courage as                                                     he was able to pilot the damaged aircraft away from built-up areas which                                                      would have resulted in a bigger disaster that would have claimed lives of                                                      many innocent Nigerians.                                                      Group  Captain  Shehu  succinctly  put  the  narrative  thus: “With  a  badly-                                                      disabled aircraft and with only a few seconds before the aircraft lost all the                                                       remaining power and control and plummeted into the ground; knowing that                                                       he was ﬂying over built-up areas, he knew he still had to do something: not                                                       just eject to save his life, rather, he steered the aircraft away from all built-up                                                       areas, with his badly- wounded aircraft, while his trained eyes scurried the                                                      earth for a possible crash site devoid of human habitation!”                                                   Without doubt, Baba-Ari apparently knew the risk he was taking as a well-                                             trained pilot, that the more time he spent in his damaged aircraft, the less chances of him                                             bailing out and saving himself, but Baba-Ari, within those remaining split seconds, knew it                                             was not only about his life. It was more about the lives of people on the ground. He                                             eventually found a safe place with no humans in sight among the hills in Katampe area of                                            the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Sadly, there was no more time or altitude for him to                                           eject and save himself so, he heroically died when his aircraft ﬁnally plummeted into the                                            mountains.                                            Few days after the ugly air collision, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique                                            Abubakar, on 2 October 2018, hosted the crew members at the Air Marshal MD Umar                                             Blue Room at the Headquarters of the NAF in Abuja, where he commended them for                                             their courage, resilience and dexterity in effectively executing the mission in spite of the                                              unfortunate air mishap.                                               Indeed,  the  CAS  could  not  mask  his  admiration  for  the  pilots  and  other  crew                                               members for their show of professionalism. He noted that the Nigerian populace                                                was, indeed, appreciative of their efforts and commitment in carrying out their                                                constitutional responsibilities. The CAS also admitted that the hazardous nature of                                               the military profession, especially air operations, implied that the element of risk                                              could never be totally eliminated. He concluded by thanking them for remaining                                                focused despite the tragic incident that cost the NAF the loss of one of its ﬁnest and                                                   very promising senior ofﬁcers and encouraged them to always remain dedicated                                                     in the performance of their assigned tasks in spite of circumstances under                                                      which they carry out their national assignment.

It is my hope, therefore, that   will give us the comparative advantage over our current and         at the end of my presentation, you would have a clear picture of   future  adversaries. The  ability  to  constantly  formulate  such         what we should expect form the Nigerian Air Force in the future.    strategies  lies  in  a  sound  vision,  which  is  vital  to  strategic         Accordingly my presentation is titled: “My Vision for the Nigerian   leadership.  Drawing  from  the  perspective  of  General  David         Air Force”.

The         military objective in conventional warfare is to bring the struggle         to a quick and decisive conclusion. Unconventional warfare on         the other hand is revolutionary, fought for political control of         states, and requiring a mix of political, economic, psychological         and military operations to drain support away from insurgents         and  build  support  for  the  government.  Indeed,  the  military         portion of the mix often plays a supporting role, and therein lies         both a dilemma and an advantage. Time is a key weapon for         insurgents as they seek a protracted conﬂict that heaps more         discredit upon the government.

A developing country can also use clandestine means to steal         design  and  technology  information  on  aircraft  and  aircraft         components that it lacks the knowledge to design and produce         domestically. The “steal” option can be used to gain blueprints or         examples of weapons to use in reverse engineering a subsystem         or  to  develop  countermeasures  that  make  the  threat  of         advanced aircraft less effective in combat. This option offers the         potential  to  acquire  advanced  systems  or  technologies  that         other countries are unwilling to sell.   In some cases, it could         allow a country acquire advanced technology without spending         funds  on  its  own  research  and  development.    However,  the         “steal” option cannot provide a developing country the ability to         absorb  or  replicate  stolen  systems  or  technologies  without         technological support from the manufacturer. Also, surreptitious         means of access can at best provide haphazard and potentially   Alpha Jet aircraft.

In the 1960s, isolated reports of DA         problems were also reported by the few psychiatric hospitals at         that time.  The 1970s and 1980s witnessed the introduction of         other drugs like cocaine, heroin, amphetamines and opioids such         as codeine and morphine. This trend changed in the 1990s to         include the abuse of non-conventional drugs. The increase in DA         made the Government to respond by establishing the National         Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in January 1990.         The efforts of the NDLEA notwithstanding, the involvement of         youths  in  DA  has  taken  a  wide  and  dangerous  dimension.         Adolescents and youths of both sexes between the ages of 13-35         years constitute the high-risk group for DA in Nigeria.

The Chairman appreciated the laudable effort         of the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar,         in rendering humanitarian services through the provision of free         healthcare to the people of the LGA. He noted that the medical         outreach had brought great relief to his people after the recent         ordeals.  During the medical outreach, the medical team from         NAF  Headquarters  and  563  NAF  Hospital,  Jos  conducted   Oral check being conducted on a patient during the NAF medical outreach in Barkin Ladi, Plateau State         medical check-ups on the patients and screened those who         potentially  had  surgical  cases  and  thereafter  immediately         conveyed them to 563 NAF Hospital, where surgeries were         carried out. Furthermore, eyeglasses and drugs were distributed         to  patients.  Other  medical  activities  carried  out  were  de-         worming  of  little  children  as  well  as  distribution  of  treated         mosquito nets.         It would be recalled that the NAF on 25 June 2018, deployed an         Mi-35P combat helicopter and an Intelligence Surveillance and         Reconnaissance  (ISR)  aircraft  to  Plateau  State  in  support  of         efforts aimed at quelling the crisis that erupted in the State. The         medical intervention was a follow-up to the earlier deployment         as part of NAF's efforts at enhancing civil-military relations.
